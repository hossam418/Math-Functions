# Math-Functions
Software Engineering 2 Assignment that helps students to become more familiar with github.

# To contribute please follow these rules
* It is recommended to use IntelliJ IDE.
* If you are using another IDE please contact me to know what you have to do.
* **Do not edit on any file like *main class* or *ISubscriber* please, Add your own code only.**
* [Tutorial to help you.](https://youtu.be/dSl_qnWO104)

# To Start
1. Fork this repository to your account
2. Clone the *Forked Repository* locally to your machine.
3. In ../src/com.company make a new class and name it as you like.
4. Make your class implements ***ISubscriber Interface*** and override *notifySubscriber Method.*
5. Write your own logic code in *notifySubscriber Method* and you can add anything you want like Methods/Variables in your class but **Logic has to be exists in *notifySubscriber Method* because this function is going to be called in the main.**
6. When you finish your code commit and push your changes to **Your Repository.**
7. Create a pull request to merge your Repository to the master Repository.

# Performance Enhancement
* First every function is optimized as max as possible.
* **When the user chooses run all functions, every function will run on single thread.**
* Note: In run all the menu is printed before printing all results. We have made this to prove that threads are working.
